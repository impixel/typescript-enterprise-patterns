# TypeScript Enterprise Patterns
TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side (Node.js) execution.

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm. Enterprise Architect provides extensive support for both creating and using Design Patterns. Patterns are typically created by experienced modelers who can see how to distil an abstract problem and solution from a concrete model. The Pattern user must be able to identify the correct Pattern to use and must select appropriate names for the elements of the Pattern in the context.
