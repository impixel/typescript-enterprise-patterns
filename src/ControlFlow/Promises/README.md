# Promises

Example of using Promise to make asynchronous HTTP calls using Node's built in `https`. Since we are on 
a subject it makes me sad when I see external libraries such as `axios`,`request-promise`,  `node-fetch` 
or any other dependency in the backend node app to make a simple http call. This happens when you hire 
frontend JS developer to do backend Node! Please be wise with the dependencies of your application and 
learn and use Node's own ecosystem.
