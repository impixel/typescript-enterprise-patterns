# Control Flow Design Patterns
This class of pattern captures elementary aspects of process control and are similar to the definitions of these concepts initially proposed by the Workflow Management Coalition.

1. __Sequence__: Async Generators
2. __Parallel Split__: child_process.spawn/fork/exec
3. __Synchronization__: Asyn/Await
4. __Exclusive Choice__: Promise.prototype.then()/catch()/finally()
5. __Simple Merge__: Promise.all()/allSettled()/race()

There are over 43 patterns, original thesis was 20 and then they published 23 more to addition of original patterns.
It is very hard for me to produce all those patterns examples in TypeScript. I will try my best to cover most relevant 
and most useful. I have started with first five and I will add more through the year.
